				<h2>A Brief Description</h2>
				<p>
				Sir Issac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire. He’s a famous mathematician that 
				has made several major contributions to the study of mathematics. Many people know the story
				of when an apple fell from a tree and hit his head which led to his discovery of gravity.
				However, Newton has done much more than get hit by an apple. One of his major contributions
				was his discovery or invention of calculus, a subject taught as part of curriculum today. 
				This discovery has led to development in fields such as astronomy and physics as its
				application to such subjects is significant to their understanding.

				<h2>A Brief Description</h2>
				<p>
				Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician that discovered Pascal’s Theorem, Pascal’s Triangle, 
				the Pascaline, the theory of probability, and Pascal’s Law. He  has made several other major 
				contributions to mathematics; however these are some of the most significant and well known. 
				Pascal’s theorem states that &quot;given a (not necessarily regular, or even convex) hexagon inscribed 
				in a conic section, the three pairs of the continuations of opposite sides meet on a straight line, 
				called the Pascal line&quot; (<a href= "https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PascalsTheorem.html#:~:text=It%20states%20that%2C%20given%20a,line%2C%20called%20the%20Pascal%20line.&text=%2Dgon%20inscribed%20in%20a%20conic,true%20for%20the%20remaining%20point.">Wolfram Math</a>) . 
				This is just a description of one of the many things he has discovered throughout his life.

				<h2>A Brief Description</h2>
				<p>
				Pythagoras was an ancient Ionian Greek mathematician who, like the other mathematicians mentioned 
				above, has made many mathematical discoveries during his time that we still continue to use today.
				One of the most notable being the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the 
				squares of the legs on a triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. It’s an extremely well 
				known theorem that is regularly used for a lot of mathematics.
