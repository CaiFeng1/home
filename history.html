			<h1>A Brief History on the Study of Mathematics</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Introduction:</h2>
			<h3>
			Mathematics has an interesting history. It’s something that always has mysteries to be solved. 
			It will continue this way as there are always new concepts to explore and prove. The majority 
			of the math that we know about today is mainly attributed to the past contributions from 
			mathematicians that are well known to us today. Explore more about these mathematicians <a href = "mathematicians.html">here.</a>

				We began our journey in Mesopotamia and Egypt around the time of 2000 BC where we can find
				the earliest mathematical texts, the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and the Rhind Mathematical
				Papyrus. These texts were found to contain information relating to algebra, geometry and arithmetic

				<p>
				However the study of mathematics became more prevalent in the 6th century BC. The Pythagoreans 
				were the ones to coin the term mathematics which stems from the Greek word μάθημα (mathema), 
				meaning "subject of instruction”.The Greek expanded knowledge of mathematics significantly and 
				they contributed much to the concepts that we now know today.

			<p>
			The Romans made almost no contributions to theoretical mathematics, however they were regularly using
			applied mathematics throughout their time. Some significant contributions like the place value system
			and the first use of negative numbers can be attributed to the Chinese mathematicians in the past.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			This is just a brief history of the origins of mathematics and from then on it has become a core part of our world and lives.
