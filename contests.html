			<h1>Contest Benefits and a Description of Math Contests</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Math contests are made to cater to those who are seeking more challenging math problems without having to learn new concepts. Contest questions make regular mathematics more difficult and require a 
			thorough understanding of the topics in order to solve the questions. They make the questions in a way where you have to think differently from what you already know and use the concepts that you've learned 
			in different ways than just the ways they were taught. There are many benefits to this. Since solving contests questions require a thorough understanding of math concepts it can enhance someone's understanding
			and if they excel in doing contest questions this means that they will excel in regular mathematics. It's also a good way to challenge even those who are extremely talented in math. Practicing math with contest
			questions allow an individual to start thinking further into what math can do, rather than what it already does.
